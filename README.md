# Homebridge Plugin for Enphase Envoy Batteries

This plugin allows automating the battery profile to switch between Full Backup and either Self Consumption or Savings mode.

## Install
Install the plugin like you would any homebridge plugin.
Configure the plugin with your credentials and siteId and desired battery thresholds.

## Add to Home
When the accessory is added to your home, it presents a switch that allows you to toggle between Full Backup and either Self Consumption
or Savings mode. You can now add automation to your home to control this, for example based on the time of day.
